## Content
* You can create an oriented graph, an unoriented graphe or maybe a mixed one.
* Create, rename and delete vertices
* Link the vertices
* Open and save graphs as **_.xml_** file
* Colorate the graphes using :
    -  GLOUTON Algorithm
    -  WELSH & POWELL Algorithm
    -  DSATUR Algorithm
* Play SUDOKU and verify your answer üòÅ

**P.S: we are using BACKTRACKING to colorate SUDOKU graph. Because, all the regular algorithms don't give the wanted used number of colors.**
